            <h2 class="section-heading">The busy airport landscape</h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">
                Airports are often bustling hubs of activity, where delays are frequent. For airlines like Southwest Airlines, these delays frustrate passengers and lead to significant financial losses. Recognizing the need for improvement, Southwest has turned its attention to optimizing its processes, particularly for passengers with reduced mobility (PRM).

            <h2 class="section-heading">Bottlenecks in boarding</h2>
            <p class="content-paragraph">
                Southwest Airlines identified the boarding process for passengers requiring wheelchair assistance as a primary source of delays. The unpredictability of how many passengers will need wheelchairs complicates the process, placing additional strain on staff during busy flights. With 75% of wheelchair users needing assistance primarily for navigating long distances within airports, it became clear that this area required urgent attention to enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction.

            <p class="content-paragraph">
                In-depth research highlighted several pain points:

            <div class="challenges-list">
                <ul>
                    <li>Wheelchair passengers often feel <strong>overlooked</strong> and <strong>lack control</strong> over their boarding experience.</li>
                    <li>Employees are frequently <strong>stretched thin</strong>, with <strong>insufficient staff</strong> to meet PRM needs.</li>
                    <li>The airline's primary goal is to <strong>reduce turn times</strong> while improving overall customer satisfaction.</li>

            </div>
            <p class="content-paragraph">
                The insights indicated a pressing need for a solution that streamlines the boarding process without requiring significant changes to existing airport operations.
