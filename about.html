        <!-- Your about content goes here -->
        <p>Hi, I’m Samvida. I started out in Computer Science Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in systems thinking and analytical problem-solving. Over time, I found myself drawn to the human side of design, to how experiences are felt, shaped, and made meaningful in everyday life. That curiosity led me to pursue a master’s degree in Design + Innovation at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where I specialized in Design Strategy and focused on aligning business goals with people-centered and life-centered design.

My Indian heritage plays a significant role in shaping my perspective on the world and my approach to design. Growing up in India, I saw how circularity, reuse, and community were part of daily life long before they were framed as sustainability trends. That upbringing shaped how I value resourcefulness, equity, and cultural context in the systems we create. It also made me more aware of how many systems in the West overlook or exploit realities in the Global South. These experiences continue to inform how I think, question norms, and advocate for more just and inclusive approaches.

To build on this perspective, I completed a certification as a Sustainability Analyst. I’m especially interested in reimagining how retail systems can support ethical labor, transparent supply chains, and thoughtful consumption. For me, sustainability is not an add-on or a feature. It is a starting point. It is embedded in how we define problems, engage communities, and design long-term solutions.

I care about designing services and systems that are intentional, grounded in trust, and built to serve people and the planet. I’m most energized when I’m unpacking complex challenges, asking why things work the way they do, and rethinking what could work better. My work lives at the intersection of innovation, responsibility, and change.</p>
