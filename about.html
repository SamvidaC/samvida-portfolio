        <h1>Beyond the Brief</h1>
        <div class="skill-card border-pink">
        <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Samvida. I started out in Computer Science Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in systems thinking and analytical problem-solving. Over time, I found myself drawn to the human side of design, to how experiences are felt, shaped, and made meaningful in everyday life. That curiosity led me to pursue a master‚Äôs degree in Design + Innovation at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where I specialized in Design Strategy and focused on aligning business goals with people-centered and life-centered design.</p>
        <p>My Indian heritage plays a significant role in shaping my perspective on the world and my approach to design. Growing up in India, I saw how circularity, reuse, and community were part of daily life long before they were framed as sustainability trends. That upbringing shaped how I value resourcefulness, equity, and cultural context in the systems we create. It also made me more aware of how many systems in the West overlook or exploit realities in the Global South. These experiences continue to inform how I think, question norms, and advocate for more just and inclusive approaches.</p>
        <p>To build on this perspective, I completed a certification as a Sustainability Analyst. I‚Äôm especially interested in reimagining how retail systems can support ethical labor, transparent supply chains, and thoughtful consumption. For me, sustainability is not an add-on or a feature. It is a starting point. It is embedded in how we define problems, engage communities, and design long-term solutions.</p>
        <p>I care about designing services and systems that are intentional, grounded in trust, and built to serve people and the planet. I‚Äôm most energized when I‚Äôm unpacking complex challenges, asking why things work the way they do, and rethinking what could work better. My work lives at the intersection of innovation, responsibility, and change.</p>

  <h2>What I Do Well</h2>
  <div class="skills-grid">
    <div class="skill-card border-green">
      <h3>Service and Systems Design</h3>
      <p>I design services that work for real people and situations. Users and the planet are at the heart of my process.<br>
        I identify every point of friction, fix it, and create efficient, user-friendly processes built to last. Whether improving accessibility, tackling waste, or advocating for ethics, I deliver solutions that run smoothly from start to finish. I focus on eliminating gaps and guesswork to ensure every system performs effectively and makes a real difference in people‚Äôs lives.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-card border-pink">
      <h3>Creative Sustainability Strategy</h3>
      <p>I develop clear, practical sustainability plans that tackle social and labor ethics, waste management, circularity, and align with business needs.<br> 
        By grounding strategies in real-world challenges, I ensure they move beyond theory into impactful action. Through advocacy and education, I help organizations embed sustainability into their core operations and culture, transforming intentions into measurable results that benefit both people and the planet.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="skill-card border-yellow">
      <h3>Research and Communication</h3>
      <p>I conduct rigorous research and transform complex data into clear insights that guide decision-making. Using methods like interviews and data analysis, I synthesize findings into reports and presentations that stakeholders understand and act upon. My communication is focused and impactful, cutting through noise to ensure findings lead to meaningful progress. I tailor my approach to each audience to maximize clarity and drive effective action.</p>
