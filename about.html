        <h1>Beyond the Brief</h1>
        <div class="skill-card beyond-brief-card border-pink">
        <p>With a background in Computer Science, my approach to design is grounded in systems thinking and analytical problem solving. But I‚Äôve always been curious about more than how systems function. I care about who they impact, how they feel, and what stories they leave out or overlook. That curiosity led me to pursue a master‚Äôs in Design + Innovation at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. There, I specialized in Design Strategy and explored how to align business needs with life-centered and people-first solutions that create long-term impact.</p>
        <p>Growing up in India, circularity wasn‚Äôt a concept. It was just life. Clothes were passed down, waste was minimal, and care was something people shared. That upbringing shaped how I think about equity, culture, and sustainability. It also made me question how dominant systems in the West often extract from or overlook the realities of the Global South. I think a lot about how colonial legacies still influence global supply chains, labor, and consumption today.</p>
        <p>My work often begins with a question. Why do we accept certain hierarchies? Who gets left out of the conversation? What would change if care were built into the design of everyday systems and services? I‚Äôm especially interested in retail and fashion, and how we might redesign those spaces to center transparency, ethical labor, and thoughtful consumption. As a certified Sustainability Analyst, I bring both research depth and cultural awareness to projects that explore waste, value, and long-term responsibility.</p>
        <p>I care about designing systems that empower people to advocate for themselves. Whether it‚Äôs artisans, consumers, or underrepresented communities, I want to create experiences that build confidence, clarity, and equity. I think in patterns, themes, and stories. Fashion, identity, and power often show up in my work, along with a deep respect for craft and context. I‚Äôm a generalist at heart, but the throughline is always care.</p>
        <p>Writing helps me process, research grounds me, and design lets me imagine what could be better. I‚Äôm most energized when I‚Äôm unpacking complex problems, connecting the dots across disciplines, and working with others who want to design systems that serve both people and the planet.</p>
